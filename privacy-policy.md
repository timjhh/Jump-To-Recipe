# Extension Privacy Policy

This extension does not collect user data, and can therefore not sell it to third parties.


## Changes to the Privacy Policy

If there are changes made to this privacy policy or to the application such that it will store user data, I will push out a new version of this extension ask users to agree to the amended privacy policy.
